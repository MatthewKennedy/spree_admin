It is recommended that you create a default menu for each menu location within each store.<br><br> <h5>More Information</h5>To learn more about menus, view the official Spree user documentation by <a href='https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/navigation/building_the_main_menu.html' target='_blank' class='alert-link'>clicking here</a>.
